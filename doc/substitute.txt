                            :SUB COMMAND                            *:Sub* *:Substitute*

The `:Sub` command provides a simple way to perform non-regex, literal string
substitutions across the entire buffer or based on visual selection.

USAGE                                                              *:Sub-usage*

:Sub {old} {new}       Replace all exact occurrences of {old} with {new}
                       in the entire buffer.

:Sub {new}             When used after visually selecting a word, replaces
                       all occurrences of the selected word with {new}.

DESCRIPTION                                                      *:Sub-details*

This command is defined in Lua and intended for straightforward substitutions.

It supports two modes:

1. Direct substitution:
        :Sub old new
        → Replaces every exact occurrence of 'old' with 'new' across the buffer.

2. Visual mode substitution:
        - Select a word using visual mode (e.g., `v` or `V`)
        - Execute:
              :Sub replacement
        → Replaces all occurrences of the selected word with 'replacement'

NOTES                                                            *:Sub-notes*

- Both {old} and {new} must be simple strings.
- Substitutions are **literal**, not regex-based.
- Special characters such as `/`, `\`, `*`, `%`, etc. are not interpreted.
- The command operates on the **entire buffer**, not a range.

EXAMPLES                                                        *:Sub-examples*

        :Sub error fixed
                → Replaces all "error" with "fixed"

        (In visual mode) select the word "cat" → :Sub dog
                → Replaces all "cat" with "dog"
